SHARE Seismic Source Toolkit
============================

The SHARE Seismic Source Toolkit is a Python plugin for QGis. It is used in 
the SHARE project to modify the seismic source zone dataset that is the 
basis for subsequent seismic hazard calculations.

NOTE:
This toolkit is an expert tool. For its intended use in SHARE, some input 
files are required, which are not public and hence are not included in 
this repository. Nevertheless, the tool may be of interest to an expert
community. Example input files for demonstration purposes will be added
later.

Requirements:

* QuakePy (www.quakepy.org)
